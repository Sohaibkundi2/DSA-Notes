## Arrays are linear data structures used to store multiple elements of the same data type under a single variable name.

- Linear data structure → Elements are stored in a sequential (one after another) manner.

- Same data type → All elements must be of the same type (e.g., all integers or all strings).

- Single variable → Instead of creating many separate variables, we can use one array to store many values.

# Day Big O Notation

The worst case of our operation is not bigger than Big O.

- To find O we ignore constants and take the largest term

- big O is also called upper bound

- it is the notation of worst case

### Common Complexities
- **O(1)** → Constant (array access)
- **O(log n)** → Logarithmic (binary search)
- **O(n)** → Linear (loop through array)
- **O(n log n)** → Linearithmic (merge sort, quicksort average case)
- **O(n²)** → Quadratic (nested loops)
- **O(2^n)** → Exponential (recursive Fibonacci)
- **O(n!)** → Factorial (permutations)

# Day 02_Space Complexity

## Time Complexity?

 **Time complexity means how the running time grows when number of input increases.**
 >Amount of time taken as a function of input size (n)

- It tells us how the number of operations grows when input increases.
- Example:
    - A loop through n elements → O(n)

    - Nested loop through n × n → O(n²)

## Space Complexity?
> Amount of space taken by an algorithm as a function of input size (n)

- we consider only oxilary space in space complexity
